BigBench

(C) 2001-2004 by - . .-.. ... .-.-.-  All rights reserved.
 
A benchmark suite to bench different versions of a module simultanously.

Note:
  This package needs newer versions of Math::BigInt and Math::BigFloat, you
  can get the at http://search.cpan.org/ or http://bloodgate.com/perl/.

To test, unzip & untar package, then look at bb.pl for settings. Then run

	perl bb.pl

A sample run is included as output.txt.

All *.inc files will be benchmarked. You can remove them if you need only some
of them. You also ned to supply a "cache" of all the versions of the modules
you want to benchmark.

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
